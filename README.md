# AI-Resume-Screening-and-Ranking-System-Project
This repository contains an AI-powered resume screening and candidate ranking system. 
It utilizes Python, Streamlit, and machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, PyPDF2, pandas) to provide an automated solution for recruiters and hiring managers. 
The system extracts text from PDF resumes, compares them to a job description using TF-IDF and cosine similarity, and ranks candidates based on their relevance.
A Streamlit web application provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
